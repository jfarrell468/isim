# The fundamental equation of early retirement states:
#
# y = log_r (1 - (1-s)(1-r)/(sw))
#
# where
#   y is years until financial independence
#   r is the real rate of return on investments (r = 1.05 for 5% return)
#   w is the safe withdrawal rate (w = 0.04 for 4% safe withdrawal)
#   s is the fraction of net income saved (s = 0.4 when saving 40% of income after taxes)
#
# With 6% return, 4% safe withdrawal rate, and 50% savings rate, the equation
# predicts y = 15.7 years of work.
#
# This figure does not account for taxes, however.
#
# This config simulates:
# - $50k of savings, including pre-tax and Roth IRAs.
# - $50k of expenses.
# - A portfolio of 75% stocks.
# - A person who starts who starts with no assets, and starts saving at age
#   25.
#
# We find that if we work for 16 years, we run out of money 25% of the time
# after 30 years of retirement. Working an extra 2 years boosts the success
# rate to 98%.
#
# The worst starting years are 1956, 1957, 1958, meaning that we would have
# retired around 1975. This suggests that high inflation around the time of
# retirement is a significant risk.
